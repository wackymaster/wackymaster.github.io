    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <h2>Here's a brief showcase of some of the projects I have worked on.
      Unfortunately, I have lost the code for some of my older programs
      (younger me wasn't aware of version control). Aside, hope you enjoy!</h2>

      <h2>Steer Calendar</h2>
      <p> This was an app I built during the spring break in tenth grade.
        Steer Calendar is an iOS app written in Swift. A student registers
        their classes using Google Firebase, which are then saved using SQLite.
        The app fetches information from the calendars of the saved classes, parses
        the iCal data, and then displays assignments and other course content on
        studentsâ€™ devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        *Note: due to the financial cost of an Apple Developer account and
        my graduation of high school, I am no longer hosting this on the app store

      <h2>Snake AI Gamebot </h2>
      <p>As the final project for my end-of-year physics class, I decided to
        play around with using AI to play games. The first game I did was
        SNAKE, where the training data was based on my own playing. The data
        contained information such as its direction, the distance to the wall,
        and the vector from the head to the red dot. I then trained the model
        against this data.

      <h2>"The Clarkanoid"</h2>
      <p>
        You are a University professor, yet suddenly you have turned into a camel.
        Your friend, the owl, has been taken by the Imperials, which the all-powerful
        "Ark" controls. Recover the owl by going on an adventure through six
        terrains, collecting valuable items, defeating a dragon in space, and
        finally battling the Ark.
      </p>
      <p> This game was made with two partners over the course of two months. The
        entire game is coded in OCaml (though it uses an SDL library for graphics).
        The game takes advantage of both functional and imperative features of OCaml.
        The Clarkanoid implements its own Entity-Component-System and features
        entirely custom pixel art, unique AI's for each enemy, and custom soundtracks,
        animations, and storylines.

      <h2>Traveling Salesman Problem</h2>
      <p>
        As one of my high school projects, I decided to look into the traveling
        salesman problem. Written in Java and using Swing, I made a program to help
        visualize the path finding. The user places specific points on the GUI,
        and then chooses the algorithm to find the shortest cycle to the starting
        position.
      </p>
      <p> The algorithms feature brute force, a greedy algorithm, a greedy algorithm
        with swapping, and an ant-colony heuristic, in which
        several "ants" travel along the paths and leave "pheremones". The paths
        with the most pheremones tends to suggest the quickest path.
