            Hello there, I'm William Wang.
          </h2>

            A little about me, I have been programming since fourth grade,
            though I was mostly dabbling in Khan Academy art and doodles.
            For reference, my first "program" was a lunar lander game I made in Khan Academy JS:
          </p>
          <div class="lunar" style=" text-align: center;">
            <img src="images/lunar_lander.png" style="width:200px" />
          </div>
          <p>
            I started to take computer science seriously in eight-ninth grade.
            I didn't have anyone teaching me how to code, so the majority (~90%)
            of my computer science background is self-taught and through personal
            projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used to code competetively, though not as frequent now. In high
            school, I competed in the American Computer Science League, where I
            have been invited to the All-Star contest
            several times and have been the highest scorer in my region
            (including several states).
          </p>
          <p>
            I built this website recently as a way to showcase some of my
            research and personal projects (many of my older programs I have lost
            the code for).
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am a sophomore at Cornell University, where I study
            computer science and physics. I’m interested in developing physical
            simulations, industrial applications, open source code, computational
            physics, etc. I also play Saxophone (member of CU Wind Symphony) and
            enjoy Nordic (Cross Country) Skiing.
          </p>
          <p>
            At any rate, that’s a quick summary about me; hopefully you’ll find
            some of my projects interesting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enjoy!
            William Wang
