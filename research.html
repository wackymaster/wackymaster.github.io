        I developed a 3D viewfactor code to simulate capsule uniformity during
        indirect-drive implosions. The program was written in FORTRAN
        (and using OpenMP for multiprocessing). I used the code to compare
        hohlraum geometries as well as test the possibilities of new target chamber
        designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also developed a novel hohlraum design (PEPR) for the OMEGA 60-beam laser.
        This design would provide great uniformity and promise insight towards
        spherical hohlraum performance. I published my first, first-author paper
        on the PEPR hohlraum (Journal: Physics of Plasmas)

        Articular cartilage demonstrates unique mechanical properties, one being
        its reponses to shear stress. The top layer of cartilage is up to 10-100
        times more compliant than the deeper layers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created a Python code to model the cartilage as a network consisting of
        nodes and bonds. The code stresses the network and then uses a conjugate
        gradient algorithm to the find minimal energy state of the networks.
        The code is written in a modular-fashion and generalized enough in that
        it can be applied to both 2-D and 3-D lattices.

      <figcaption>*The animation shown only uses around 10^2 nodes,
        though the code can easily handle beyond 10^4.

      <h2>Clinical Cardiovascular Research Center</h2>
      <p>
        Around middle-high school, I developed several softwares at CCRC of
        University of Rochester. The first being QTClock (shown on the left).
      </p>
      <p>
        QTClock obtained data from ECG recordings and plotted both the QT
        interval along with a color gradient corresponding to the patientâ€™s
        intake drug concentration in a clock-like graph.
        I also developed an online calculator that assesses the absolute risk of
        life-threatening cardiac events in patients with long QT syndrome.
