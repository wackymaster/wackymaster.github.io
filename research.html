          I developed a 3D viewfactor code to simulate capsule uniformity during
          indirect-drive implosions. The program was written in FORTRAN (and
          using OpenMP for multiprocessing). I used the code to compare hohlraum
          geometries as well as test the possibilities of new target chamber
          designs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also developed a novel hohlraum design (PEPR) for the OMEGA 60-beam
          laser. This design would provide great uniformity and promise insight
          towards spherical hohlraum performance. I published my first,
          first-author paper on the PEPR hohlraum (Journal: Physics of Plasmas)

        <p>
          Articular cartilage demonstrates unique mechanical properties, one
          being its reponses to shear stress. The top layer of cartilage is up
          to 10-100 times more compliant than the deeper layers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created a Python code to model the cartilage as a network consisting
          of nodes and bonds. The code stresses the network and then uses a
          conjugate gradient algorithm to the find minimal energy state of the
          networks. The code is written in a modular-fashion and generalized
          enough in that it can be applied to both 2-D and 3-D lattices.

          *The animation shown only uses around 10^2 nodes, though the code can
          easily handle beyond 10^4.

        <h2>Panoptic Segmentation of Cartilage</h2>
        <p>
		An implementation of Mask R-CNN was trained on images/frames of impacted
		cartilage. The initial weights were pre-trained on the COCO dataset to
		support transfer learning, so only the head layers were trained.
        </p>
        <p>
		Due to the noisiness of the dataset and limited training time, the 
		model was not robust enough to perform segmentation to a high certainty.
		However, the results suggest that much of noise and inaccuracies within 
		the pre-labeled dataset were not as present within the model.

        <h2>Clinical Cardiovascular Research Center</h2>
        <p>
          Around middle-high school, I developed several softwares at CCRC of
          University of Rochester. The first being QTClock (shown on the left).
        </p>
        <p>
          QTClock obtained data from ECG recordings and plotted both the QT
          interval along with a color gradient corresponding to the patientâ€™s
          intake drug concentration in a clock-like graph. I also developed an
          online calculator that assesses the absolute risk of life-threatening
          cardiac events in patients with long QT syndrome.
